- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm RubÃ©n from MÃ¡laga, student of 42's MÃ¡laga. I am a curious and committed person with a great desire to continue learning programming.
I'm currently learning C, but I have knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Also, I have experience with Linux, Unix, virtual machines, etc.
One of the sectors in which I would like to put my skills into practice is the cybersecurity sector. I have a degree in Security and Risk Management,
making me develop a special interest in this profession, as I really enjoy being able to help others.
